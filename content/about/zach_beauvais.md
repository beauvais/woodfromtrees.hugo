I make useful things from trees.

I start every one of my projects with a tree. If I'm lucky, I get to fell it. But sometimes, I pick up a recently-felled log. I split green logs with a froe, axe, and wedges. The resulting planks (called billets) then face a carving axe for rough shaping.

Once the shape is roughed out, I move on to refining with straight blades and hook knives (which let me hollow out bowls).

I don't use sandpaper or other abrasives, so everything is tool-finished. This leaves a durable, smooth surface that weathers better than abraded wood which can tear or fluff up when soaked.

I design and make things to be used, even if they might be good to look at.
